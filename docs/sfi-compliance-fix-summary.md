# SFI Compliance Fix Summary

## Date: August 12, 2025

## Issues Identified ‚ùå
1. **NO JIT policies configured** despite `-SfiEnable` flag
2. **SSH (port 22) open to entire VirtualNetwork** instead of specific IP
3. **RDP (port 3389) potentially open** with broad access
4. **JIT access not configured** for deployer IP address

## Immediate Fixes Applied ‚úÖ

### 1. JIT Policies Configured
```
‚úÖ JIT policy created for 1 VMs in centralus
‚úÖ JIT policy created for 1 VMs in southeastasia  
‚úÖ JIT policy created for 4 VMs in westus
‚úÖ Total: 6/6 VMs protected with JIT access
```

### 2. Permissive NSG Rules Removed
**Before (‚ùå INSECURE):**
- SSH port 22: `Source: VirtualNetwork` (allows entire VWAN)
- RDP port 3389: `Source: VirtualNetwork` (if present)

**After (‚úÖ SECURE):**
- SSH port 22: **NO permissive rules** 
- RDP port 3389: **NO permissive rules**
- Access only through JIT approval

### 3. Security Model Now Correct
- **Default**: All SSH/RDP access DENIED
- **JIT Required**: Access only through Azure Security Center approval
- **Time-Limited**: Access automatically expires after specified duration
- **IP-Specific**: Access granted only to approved IP addresses

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed Components
- **JIT Policies**: Configured for all 6 VMs across 3 regions
- **NSG Rules**: Removed all permissive SSH/RDP rules
- **Security Posture**: Now follows Secure Future Initiative requirements

### üîÑ Manual Step Required: JIT Access Request

**You need to request JIT access through Azure Portal:**

1. **Navigate to**: Azure Security Center ‚Üí Just-in-Time VM access
2. **Select VMs**: Choose the VMs you want to access
3. **Request Access**: 
   - **Source IP**: `72.69.168.20/32` (your current IP)
   - **Port 22**: SSH access for Linux VMs
   - **Port 3389**: RDP access for Windows VMs  
   - **Duration**: 1-3 hours as needed

**Alternative Azure CLI (if supported):**
```bash
# This command structure may need adjustment based on Azure CLI version
az security jit-policy show --resource-group "rg-vwanlab" --location "westus" --name "default"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why SFI Wasn't Working Initially

1. **Deployment Script Issue**: The `-SfiEnable` flag wasn't properly creating JIT policies during deployment
2. **NSG Precedence**: Permissive NSG rules took precedence over JIT restrictions
3. **Auto-Provisioning**: Defender for Cloud auto-provisioning was OFF

### Template/Script Problems

The deployment templates were creating permissive NSG rules that contradicted SFI requirements:
- `AllowSSHFromVirtualNetwork` rules with broad access
- No automatic JIT policy creation during VM deployment
- No post-deployment security hardening

## Validation Commands

### Check JIT Status
```powershell
# Verify JIT policies exist
az security jit-policy list --resource-group rg-vwanlab --output table

# Check specific policy details  
az security jit-policy show --resource-group "rg-vwanlab" --location "westus" --name "default"
```

### Verify NSG Security
```powershell
# Confirm no permissive SSH/RDP rules
az network nsg list --resource-group rg-vwanlab --query "[].{Name:name, SecurityRules:securityRules[?access=='Allow' && (destinationPortRange=='22' || destinationPortRange=='3389')]}" --output table
```

### Test Connectivity
```powershell
# Before JIT approval (should fail)
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 azureuser@<vm-ip>

# After JIT approval (should succeed)  
ssh azureuser@<vm-ip>
```

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate (Manual)
1. **Request JIT Access** through Azure Security Center for your IP (`72.69.168.20`)
2. **Test Access** to confirm SSH/RDP works with JIT approval
3. **Verify Security** that access fails without JIT approval

### Future Deployments (Automated)
1. **Fix Deployment Scripts**: Ensure `-SfiEnable` properly configures JIT during deployment
2. **Update Templates**: Remove permissive NSG rules from Bicep templates
3. **Auto-Request JIT**: Add automatic JIT access request for deployer IP

## Security Posture

### Before Fix ‚ùå
- **High Risk**: SSH open to entire VWAN network
- **No JIT**: Direct access without approval
- **Compliance**: Failed SFI requirements

### After Fix ‚úÖ  
- **Low Risk**: All access requires JIT approval
- **Time-Limited**: Access automatically expires
- **IP-Restricted**: Access only from approved IPs
- **Compliance**: Meets SFI requirements

## Files That Need Updates

1. **Deployment Script**: `scripts/Deploy-VwanLab.ps1` - Fix SFI implementation
2. **Bicep Templates**: Remove permissive NSG rules from Phase 1/2 templates
3. **JIT Script**: `scripts/Set-VmJitAccess.ps1` - Add automatic access request
4. **Documentation**: Update SFI deployment instructions

The immediate security issues have been resolved, but you'll need to request JIT access manually to connect to the VMs. üîí
