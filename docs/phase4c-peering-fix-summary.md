# Phase 4c Peering Fix Summary

## Issue Description

Phase 4c deployment was failing with the following error:
```
Resource /subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/rg-vwanlab-demo/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vwanlab-route-server-vnet referenced by resource .../virtualNetworkPeerings/to-route-server-peering was not found.
```

## Root Cause

The Phase 4c peering template (`bicep/phases/phase4c-peering.bicep`) was still referencing the old VNet name `vwanlab-route-server-vnet`, which was renamed to `vwanlab-spoke3-vnet` as part of the Spoke 3 naming standardization.

## Solution

Updated the Phase 4c peering template to use the new Spoke 3 naming convention:

### Changes Made

1. **VNet Reference Update**:
   - **Old**: `${environmentPrefix}-route-server-vnet`
   - **New**: `${environmentPrefix}-spoke3-vnet`

2. **Resource Name Updates**:
   - **Old**: `routeServerVnet` → **New**: `spoke3Vnet`
   - **Old**: `spoke1ToRouteServerPeering` → **New**: `spoke1ToSpoke3Peering`
   - **Old**: `routeServerToSpoke1Peering` → **New**: `spoke3ToSpoke1Peering`

3. **Peering Name Updates**:
   - **Old**: `to-route-server-peering` → **New**: `to-spoke3-peering`

4. **Output Updates**:
   - Updated all output references to use new resource names
   - Maintained same functionality with correct naming

### Updated Template Structure

```bicep
// Phase 4c: VNet Peering Between Spoke1 and Spoke3 VNet for NVA-Route Server BGP
// Create peering to allow NVA in spoke1 to communicate with Route Server in spoke3

// Get existing VNets
resource spokeVnet1 'Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks@2024-05-01' existing = {
  name: '${environmentPrefix}-spoke1-vnet'
}

resource spoke3Vnet 'Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks@2024-05-01' existing = {
  name: '${environmentPrefix}-spoke3-vnet'
}

// Create bidirectional peering
resource spoke1ToSpoke3Peering 'Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings@2024-05-01' = {
  parent: spokeVnet1
  name: 'to-spoke3-peering'
  // ... peering configuration
}

resource spoke3ToSpoke1Peering 'Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings@2024-05-01' = {
  parent: spoke3Vnet  
  name: 'to-spoke1-peering'
  // ... peering configuration
}
```

## Verification

1. **Template Compilation**: ✅ Bicep template compiles successfully
2. **Naming Consistency**: ✅ All references use spoke3 naming convention
3. **Functionality Preserved**: ✅ Peering configuration unchanged, only names updated

## Impact

- **Deployment**: Phase 4c will now deploy successfully
- **Functionality**: No change to network peering behavior
- **Architecture**: Maintains BGP connectivity between Spoke 1 NVA and Spoke 3 Route Server
- **Naming**: Consistent with overall spoke-based naming convention

## Files Modified

- `bicep/phases/phase4c-peering.bicep` - Updated VNet references and resource names

## Next Steps

The Phase 4c deployment should now complete successfully with the updated VNet references. The peering will be established between:
- **Spoke 1 VNet** (`vwanlab-spoke1-vnet`) 
- **Spoke 3 VNet** (`vwanlab-spoke3-vnet`)

This enables BGP communication between the NVA VM in Spoke 1 and the Route Server in Spoke 3.
