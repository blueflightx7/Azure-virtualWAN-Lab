### **üìà Cost Optimization Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Infrastructure-Only**
Remove all VMs, keep networking infrastructure
- **Monthly Cost**: $413.80
- **Savings**: $91.98 (18%)
- **Use Case**: Network architecture demos, BGP topology learning

#### **Scenario 2: Auto-Shutdown (12h/day)**
Shutdown VMs during non-business hours
- **Monthly Cost**: $380.59
- **Savings**: $125.19 (25%)
- **Use Case**: Scheduled training, workshops

#### **Scenario 3: No Route Server**
Remove Route Server for basic VWAN demos
- **Monthly Cost**: $323.28
- **Savings**: $182.50 (36%)
- **Use Case**: Basic VWAN connectivity testing

### **üîç Cost Analysis by Category**

| Category | Cost | Percentage | Justification |
|----------|------|------------|---------------|
| **Networking Core** | $369.70 | 73% | Essential VWAN + Route Server |
| **Compute** | $50.37 | 10% | Mixed VM sizing optimal |
| **Storage** | $41.61 | 8% | Standard_LRS cost-effective |
| **Public IPs** | $14.60 | 3% | Required for connectivity |
| **Data Transfer** | $5.00 | 1% | Minimal for lab usage |
| **Other** | $24.50 | 5% | Miscellaneous services |

### **üí° Optimization Recommendations**

#### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Keep Current Configuration** - The mixed VM sizing is already optimized
2. **Consider Auto-Shutdown** - Can save $125/month for part-time usage
3. **Monitor Data Transfer** - Typically minimal for lab scenarios

#### **Advanced Optimizations**
1. **Reserved Instances** - For long-term usage (1+ years)
2. **Spot VMs** - For non-critical test scenarios
3. **Regional Selection** - Consider cheaper regions for non-production

### **üìä Historical Cost Comparison**

| Metric | Previous Analysis | 2025 Analysis | Change |
|--------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| **Hourly Cost** | $0.61 | $0.69 | +$0.08 (+13%) |
| **Monthly Cost** | $425 | $506 | +$81 (+19%) |
| **VM Percentage** | 15% | 10% | Networking dominates |
| **Network Percentage** | 75% | 73% | Still largest component |

### **üéØ Pricing Accuracy**

This analysis is based on:
- **Azure Retail Prices API** (January 2025)
